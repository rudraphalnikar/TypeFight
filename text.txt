As the world heats up, more and more species find 
it harder to live in their natural environments.
Even 1 or 2 degrees of increase makes a huge
difference in our planet. Showering 15 minutes
instead of 30 or wasting less food helps the 
Earth.

#You have completed all the typing lessons!
When children reach 6 years old, their drawings matter.
Not because of those purple unicorns or pinestripe
dragons but because of how kids stretch themselves
and the very real people in their lives.

#Time to put these typing skills to use!
A moth is not a moth in mother,
nor both in bother, broth in brother,
And dead, it is said like bed, not bead,
For goodness sake do not call it deed,
Watch out for meat and great and threat.
They rhyme with suite and straight and debt.

#Hold down shift to type capital letters
We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,
But the plural of ox should be oxen, not oxes.
Then one fowl is goose, but 2 are called geese,
Yet the plural of moose should never be meese,
You may find a lone mouse or a whole nest of mice,
But the plural of house is houses, not hice.

#Keep your thumbs on the spacebar
He was a big man, says the size of his shoes
on a pile of broken dishes by the house.
a tall man too, says the length of the bed
but not a man for farming, say the fields,
cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn.

#Beware of the excessive punctuation
Whenever Richard Cory went down town,
We people on the pavement looked at him.
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
Clean favored, and imperially slim.

#To type the question mark, move your right pinky down two rows.
If the plural of man is always called men,
Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?
The cow in the plural may be cows or kine,
But a bow if repeated is never called bine,
And the plural of vow is vows, never vine.

#Do not assume the words based on their rhymes.
And cord and work and card and ward,
And font and front and word and sword,
And do and go and thwart and cart
Come come, I have hardly made a start!
A dreadful language, Man alive,
I had mastered it when I was five!

#To type the apostrophe, move your right pinky to the right once.
If the singular's this and the plural is these,
Should the plural of kiss ever be nicknamed keese?
Then one may be that and three would be those,
Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,
And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.

#Watch out for the old Engligh vocabulary!
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate.
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

#Tip: Keep your index fingers on the f and j keys
If I speak of a foot and you show me your feet,
And I give you a boot would a pair be called beet?
If one is a tooth, and a whole set are teeth,
Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?

#Prepare to use the shift key here.
And he was always quietly arrayed,
And he was always human when he talked.
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
Good Morning, and he glittered when he walked.

#A shorter paragraph as a gift for playing well.
We speak of a brother, and also of brethren,
But though we say mother, we never say methren,
Then the masculine pronouns are he, his, and him,
But imagine the feminine she, shis, and shim.

#Remember the locations of the keys for this level
Beware of heard, a dreadful word
That looks like beard and sounds like bird.
And here is not a match for there
Nor dear and fear for bear and pear,
And then there is dose and rose and lose,
Just look them up, and goose and choose.

#Could this be the last level? I don't know, type to find out.
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends posessed,
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least.
